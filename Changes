Changes for CPAN::PackageDetails

0.25_05 - Mon Apr 18 17:15:56 2011
	* rjbs made the columns in the packages file line up (mostly)

0.25_04 - Wed Aug 25 18:14:46 2010
	* Added disallow_alpha_versions. add_entry will complain and not 
	add alpha versions, and as_unique_sorted_list will ignore them.
	* Add warnings to add_entry and as_unique_sorted_list when
	version.pm thinks it's run into a bad version string.

0.25_03 - Tue Apr 20 14:57:51 2010
	* Add DBM::Deep as a pre-requisite

0.25_02 - Sun Apr 11 15:58:48 2010
	* You can now use a DBM::Deep object as the packages object
	so you can parse a 02packages file and keep the result. Let's
	see how CPAN Testers like it first, though.

0.25 - Mon Dec 28 09:22:48 2009
	* This version notes that you need at least version.pm 
	0.77 to handle the version parsing.

0.2401 - Mon Nov 30 15:12:51 2009
	* *::Entries->add_entry now croaks if you pass it a package
	that doesn't look like a valid Perl namespace.

0.24 - Fri Nov 20 05:52:50 2009
	* I got the check_file tests named backward. Now they are
	right side up.

0.23 - Thu Nov 19 22:04:35 2009
	* Re-jiggered the error reporting from check_file. Now
	you get back a reference that gives you a lot more 
	information. You should call check_file in an eval
	then look for the error object in $@.

0.22 - Wed Nov 18 19:21:56 2009
	* check_file() now dies with a reference if it encounters 
	a problem so you have greater control over error
	handling.

0.21_07 - Tue Nov 17 03:03:56 2009
	* Fix the version sorting in as_unique_sorted_list. 
	I'm using version.pm against my better judgement,
	and that's all messed up with Module::Build.

0.21_02 - Sun Aug 16 20:03:44 CDT 2009
	* add the check_file() routine to compare a 02packages to a
	repo to see if it matches: all file in the repo in 02packages,
	all files in 02packages in the repo, etc.
	* I reorganized the code so all the classes are in separate
	files. Things are so much easier now, and the dispatching
	is much easier to follow.
	
0.20 - Fri Jul 17 03:47:00 2009
	* Write to a temporary file first, then rename to the final
	name so parallel runs don't write to the same file.

0.19 - Wed Jun 10 18:42:10 2009
	* Improve performance a bit by re-jiggering the internal 
	data structure for easier data slicing
	* Add the allow_packages_only_once configuration option
	and the already_added() method to allow better performance
	by remembering less.

0.18 - Thu Mar 12 05:59:37 2009
	* Fixed a problem counting the number of entries that would be
	in the file
	* Now you can get a list of just the highest version of any
	package that you add

0.17_03 - Thu Mar  5 04:33:46 2009
	* ->as_unique_sorted_list() returns just the latest version for
	each package name, no matter what you've added.
	* Now that I can get the unique list, I can fix the line 
	count in the header.

0.17 - Fri Feb 13 14:29:33 2009
	* Format the date the way CPAN.pm expects it, despite the
	locale of the user. Everyone should upgrade to this version.

0.15 - Mon Nov 10 07:58:39 2008
	* Sort the package names in the output

0.13 - Wed Nov  5 02:13:53 2008
	* Put in the literal "undef" as a placeholder for columns
	with null data (such as modules without versions)

0.12 - Fri Oct 31 07:55:02 2008
	* Bump to release version

0.11_03 - Mon Oct 27 15:04:50 2008
	* Use IO::Compress::Zlib instead of PerlIO::gzip, which doesn't
	work on Windows.

0.11_02 - Mon Oct 27 13:17:32 2008
	* Add the new test files to the MANIFEST so they show up
	in the dist :)

0.11_01 - Fri Oct 24 10:08:23 2008
	* Re-organized some of the methods and improved the docs,
	added even more tests

0.10_01 - Fri Oct 24 07:21:20 2008
	* Initial release: You can create or read 02packages.details.txt.gz.
