Revision history for Perl module CPAN::PackageDetails

0.261 2018-06-12T13:48:14Z
	* Change to Artistic License 2.0

0.26 - 2014-01-03
	* Get rid of MYMETA

0.25_05 - 2011-04-18
	* rjbs made the columns in the packages file line up (mostly)

0.25_04 - 2010-08-25
	* Added disallow_alpha_versions. add_entry will complain and not
	add alpha versions, and as_unique_sorted_list will ignore them.
	* Add warnings to add_entry and as_unique_sorted_list when
	version.pm thinks it's run into a bad version string.

0.25_03 - 2010-04-20
	* Add DBM::Deep as a pre-requisite

0.25_02 - 2010-04-11
	* You can now use a DBM::Deep object as the packages object
	so you can parse a 02packages file and keep the result. Let's
	see how CPAN Testers like it first, though.

0.25 - 2009-12-28
	* This version notes that you need at least version.pm
	0.77 to handle the version parsing.

0.2401 - 2009-11-30
	* *::Entries->add_entry now croaks if you pass it a package
	that doesn't look like a valid Perl namespace.

0.24 - 2009-11-20
	* I got the check_file tests named backward. Now they are
	right side up.

0.23 - 2009-11-19
	* Re-jiggered the error reporting from check_file. Now
	you get back a reference that gives you a lot more
	information. You should call check_file in an eval
	then look for the error object in $@.

0.22 - 2009-11-18
	* check_file() now dies with a reference if it encounters
	a problem so you have greater control over error
	handling.

0.21_07 - 2009-11-17
	* Fix the version sorting in as_unique_sorted_list.
	I'm using version.pm against my better judgement,
	and that's all messed up with Module::Build.

0.21_02 - 2009-08-16
	* add the check_file() routine to compare a 02packages to a
	repo to see if it matches: all file in the repo in 02packages,
	all files in 02packages in the repo, etc.
	* I reorganized the code so all the classes are in separate
	files. Things are so much easier now, and the dispatching
	is much easier to follow.

0.20 - 2009-07-17
	* Write to a temporary file first, then rename to the final
	name so parallel runs don't write to the same file.

0.19 - 2009-06-10
	* Improve performance a bit by re-jiggering the internal
	data structure for easier data slicing
	* Add the allow_packages_only_once configuration option
	and the already_added() method to allow better performance
	by remembering less.

0.18 - 2009-03-12
	* Fixed a problem counting the number of entries that would be
	in the file
	* Now you can get a list of just the highest version of any
	package that you add

0.17_03 - 2009-03-05
	* ->as_unique_sorted_list() returns just the latest version for
	each package name, no matter what you've added.
	* Now that I can get the unique list, I can fix the line
	count in the header.

0.17 - 2009-02-13
	* Format the date the way CPAN.pm expects it, despite the
	locale of the user. Everyone should upgrade to this version.

0.15 - 2008-11-10
	* Sort the package names in the output

0.13 - 2008-11-05
	* Put in the literal "undef" as a placeholder for columns
	with null data (such as modules without versions)

0.12 - 2008-10-31
	* Bump to release version

0.11_03 - 2008-10-27
	* Use IO::Compress::Zlib instead of PerlIO::gzip, which doesn't
	work on Windows.

0.11_02 - 2008-10-27
	* Add the new test files to the MANIFEST so they show up
	in the dist :)

0.11_01 - 2008-10-24
	* Re-organized some of the methods and improved the docs,
	added even more tests

0.10_01 - 2008-10-24
	* Initial release: You can create or read 02packages.details.txt.gz.
